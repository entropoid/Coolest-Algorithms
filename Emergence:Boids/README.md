## Emergence

Emergence is a phenomenon that occurs when a group of simple agents interact with each other and their environment. The agents follow a set of rules that govern their behavior, and as a result, complex patterns emerge at the group level. Emergence is a key concept in the field of artificial life, which studies how simple rules can give rise to complex behavior.

This Golang implementation of Boids demonstrates the concept of emergence in action. Boids are simple agents that follow three rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. These rules govern how individual boids move in relation to their neighbors, resulting in complex flocking behavior at the group level.
