RDA can create various patterns even with minor changes in the parameters: mitosis, coral pattern and this sci-fi looking thingy are the only ones I have explored till now.
  TODO:
- [x] Implement the algorithm
- [x] incorporate Orientation: diffusion can occur faster in one direction than another to give an orientation to the results.
- [ ] incorporate Style Map: the feed and kill rates can vary across the grid to give different patterns in different areas.
- [ ] incorporate Flow: the chemicals can flow across the grid to give various dynamic effects.
- [ ] incorporate Scale: the size of the pattern changes when the reaction rate is sped up or slowed down relative to the diffusion rate.
